now i want to improve computer hit
need a way to get random tile to hit
if its a hit keep it
get possible none visited before movements
so i will have an array of opponent tiles
if any of the adjacent tiles is a hit go in that direction until its sunk or miss
keep the start tile if that root ended with miss
then go the opposite direction b
if its not remove it and next turn get a new random tile to be the start tile

if both sides of a hit tile is end with miss
